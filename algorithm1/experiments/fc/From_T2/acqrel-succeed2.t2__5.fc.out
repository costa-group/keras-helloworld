 ===========================
TOO MANY TRIES with node:  n_l0

phi props: {
	 n_l1 : ((0.001953125 - D >= 0 AND	 - C >= 0)) 
	 n_l0 : ((0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 - D >= 0))))))))))) 

}
some nodes (['n_l0']) where ignored after 10 iterations.
