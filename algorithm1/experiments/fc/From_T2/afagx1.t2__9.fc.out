 ===========================
TOO MANY TRIES with node:  n_l1

phi props: {
	 n_l2 : (-1.0 - A >= 0 	OR -1.0 + A >= 0) 
	 n_l1 : ((0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 ()))))))))))) 
	 n_l0 : (()) 

}
some nodes (['n_l1']) where ignored after 10 iterations.
