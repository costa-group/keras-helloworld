 ===========================
TOO MANY TRIES with node:  n_l0

phi props: {
	 n_l0 : (-1.0 + A >= 0 	OR (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 (0 >= 0 AND	 -1.0 + A >= 0))))))))))) 
	 n_l2 : ((-0.001953125000000014 + A >= 0 AND	 ())) 
	 n_l1 : ((-0.001953125000000014 + A >= 0 AND	 ())) 

}
some nodes (['n_l0']) where ignored after 10 iterations.
